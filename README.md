# OTT-Media-Dashboard-Power-BI
This is a Power BI project showcasing an in-depth analysis of streaming service data, providing detailed insights on IMDb Scores, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, show durations, yearly releases, and more.
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of popular platforms like Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, and Prime Video.
At the top left corner of every page, I have added icons for the next and previous pages which act as the page navigation button. The logo displaying the currently open page works as a hyperlink to take the user directly to the website of the respective streaming platform.
